Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as sources of historical information, motivating the need for scalable audits on contested events and politically charged narratives in settings that mirror real user interactions. We introduce \textsc{\texttt{HistoricalMisinfo}}, a curated dataset of $500$ contested events from $45$ countries, each paired with a factual reference narrative and a documented revisionist reference narrative. To approximate real-world usage, we instantiate each event in $11$ prompt scenarios that reflect common communication settings (e.g., questions, textbooks, social posts, policy briefs). Using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol that compares model outputs to the two references, we evaluate LLMs varying across model architectures in two conditions: (i) neutral user prompts that ask for factually accurate information, and (ii) robustness prompts in which the user explicitly requests the revisionist version of the event. Under neutral prompts, models are generally closer to factual references, though the resulting scores should be interpreted as reference-alignment signals rather than definitive evidence of human-interpretable revisionism. Robustness prompting yields a strong and consistent effect: when the user requests the revisionist narrative, all evaluated models show sharply higher revisionism scores, indicating limited resistance or self-correction. \textsc{\texttt{HistoricalMisinfo}} provides a practical foundation for benchmarking robustness to revisionist framing and for guiding future work on more precise automatic evaluation of contested historical claims to ensure a sustainable integration of AI systems within society.

Summary:
Purpose: The paper aims to detect historical revisionism in large language models, which are increasingly used as sources of historical information, by introducing a curated dataset and evaluating the models' performance in various prompt scenarios.
Method: The researchers use an LLM-as-a-judge protocol to compare model outputs to factual and revisionist reference narratives across different model architectures and prompt conditions, including neutral and robustness prompts.
Results: The evaluation shows that while models are generally closer to factual references under neutral prompts, they exhibit sharply higher revisionism scores when prompted with robustness requests, indicating limited resistance to revisionist framing.

### Same Meaning, Different Scores: Lexical and Syntactic Sensitivity in LLM Evaluation (2602.17316v1)

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established standardized evaluation benchmarks as the primary instrument for model comparison. Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.

### On the Reliability of User-Centric Evaluation of Conversational Recommender Systems (2602.17264v1)

Abstract: User-centric evaluation has become a key paradigm for assessing Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS), aiming to capture subjective qualities such as satisfaction, trust, and rapport. To enable scalable evaluation, recent work increasingly relies on third-party annotations of static dialogue logs by crowd workers or large language models. However, the reliability of this practice remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the reliability and structure of user-centric CRS evaluation on static dialogue transcripts. We collected 1,053 annotations from 124 crowd workers on 200 ReDial dialogues using the 18-dimensional CRS-Que framework. Using random-effects reliability models and correlation analysis, we quantify the stability of individual dimensions and their interdependencies. Our results show that utilitarian and outcome-oriented dimensions such as accuracy, usefulness, and satisfaction achieve moderate reliability under aggregation, whereas socially grounded constructs such as humanness and rapport are substantially less reliable. Furthermore, many dimensions collapse into a single global quality signal, revealing a strong halo effect in third-party judgments. These findings challenge the validity of single-annotator and LLM-based evaluation protocols and motivate the need for multi-rater aggregation and dimension reduction in offline CRS evaluation.

### Quantifying and Mitigating Socially Desirable Responding in LLMs: A Desirability-Matched Graded Forced-Choice Psychometric Study (2602.17262v1)

Abstract: Human self-report questionnaires are increasingly used in NLP to benchmark and audit large language models (LLMs), from persona consistency to safety and bias assessments. Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.

Summary:
Purpose: The study aims to quantify and mitigate socially desirable responding in large language models (LLMs) when using human self-report questionnaires for evaluation, as these instruments assume honest responding but can be biased by socially preferred answers.
Method: To address this issue, the researchers propose a psychometric framework that involves administering the same inventory under different instructions and computing socially desirable responding as a standardized effect size from item response theory-estimated latent scores.
Results: The study finds that using a desirability-matched graded forced-choice inventory substantially attenuates socially desirable responding in LLMs while preserving the recovery of intended persona profiles, highlighting the need for socially desirable responding-aware reporting practices in questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.

### When LLM Judges Inflate Scores: Exploring Overrating in Relevance Assessment (2602.17170v1)

Abstract: Human relevance assessment is time-consuming and cognitively intensive, limiting the scalability of Information Retrieval evaluation. This has led to growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) as proxies for human judges. However, it remains an open question whether LLM-based relevance judgments are reliable, stable, and rigorous enough to match humans for relevance assessment. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of overrating behavior in LLM-based relevance judgments across model backbones, evaluation paradigms (pointwise and pairwise), and passage modification strategies. We show that models consistently assign inflated relevance scores -- often with high confidence -- to passages that do not genuinely satisfy the underlying information need, revealing a system-wide bias rather than random fluctuations in judgment. Furthermore, controlled experiments show that LLM-based relevance judgments can be highly sensitive to passage length and surface-level lexical cues. These results raise concerns about the usage of LLMs as drop-in replacements for human relevance assessors, and highlight the urgent need for careful diagnostic evaluation frameworks when applying LLMs for relevance assessments. Our code and results are publicly available.
